# Digital Logic Tools
#### A collection of python files that make the complex processes and math behind designing and building digital components just a little bit easier. When it comes to designing more advanced digital components, even the basic tasks like truth tables, MSOP and MPOS equations, or VHDL code become more and more time consuming. These python scripts will be useful in executing these simple processes for you and saving plenty of time in the design process.  
List of Tools so far:  
- Program that when given a sum of products (SOP) equation, will generate the VHDL code in order to implement that equation. Can make the design of digital components such as asynchronous state machines (ASM) much faster.
